# Minesweeper Implementation Guide

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for creating a Minesweeper game in Kotlin.

## Step 1: Data Structure Design

### Cell State Enumeration
```kotlin
enum class CellState {
    HIDDEN,    // Initial state of cell
    REVEALED,  // Cell has been clicked and revealed
    FLAGGED    // Cell has been flagged as potential mine
}
```

### Cell Data Structure
```kotlin
data class Cell(
    val hasMine: Boolean,        // Whether cell contains a mine
    val state: CellState,        // Current state of the cell
    val adjacentMines: Int       // Number of adjacent mines (0-8)
)
```

### Game Board Structure
```kotlin
class Board(
    val width: Int,              // Board width
    val height: Int,             // Board height
    val mineCount: Int,          // Total number of mines
    val grid: Array<Array<Cell>> // 2D array of cells
)
```

## Step 2: Board Initialization

1. Board Creation:
   - Initialize empty grid with specified dimensions
   - Randomly distribute mines across the board
   - Calculate adjacent mine counts for each cell

2. Adjacent Mines Calculation:
   - For each non-mine cell, check all 8 surrounding positions
   - Count and store the number of adjacent mines

## Step 3: Game Logic Implementation

### Cell Revelation Logic
- Reveal single cell
- Implement flood fill algorithm for empty cells
- Check for game-over condition

### Flagging System
- Toggle flag state on cells
- Track number of placed flags
- Validate against total mine count

### Win Condition Verification
- Check if all non-mine cells are revealed
- Alternatively, verify all mines are correctly flagged

## Step 4: Game State Management

### Game State Enumeration
```kotlin
enum class GameState {
    ONGOING,   // Game is in progress
    WON,       // Player has won
    LOST       // Player has hit a mine
}
```

### State Tracking
- Update game state after each move
- Handle game over scenarios
- Special handling for first move

## Step 5: Helper Functions

### Coordinate Validation
- Verify coordinates are within board boundaries
- Validate move legality

### Neighbor Cell Operations
- Get all valid adjacent cells
- Handle edge and corner cases properly

## Step 6: Game Actions API

### Public Interface
```kotlin
interface MinesweeperGame {
    fun revealCell(x: Int, y: Int): Boolean
    fun toggleFlag(x: Int, y: Int): Boolean
    fun getGameState(): GameState
    fun getCellState(x: Int, y: Int): CellState
}
```

## Step 7: First Move Safety

### First Move Guarantee
- Ensure first revealed cell is safe
- Relocate mine if necessary
- Recalculate adjacent mine counts

## Step 8: Board Difficulty Presets

### Difficulty Settings
```kotlin
enum class Difficulty(val width: Int, val height: Int, val mines: Int) {
    BEGINNER(9, 9, 10),
    INTERMEDIATE(16, 16, 40),
    EXPERT(30, 16, 99)
}
```

## Step 9: Game Reset and State Management

### Reset Functionality
- Clear all cells
- Redistribute mines
- Reset game state to initial

## Step 10: Utility Functions

### Board Representation
- String representation for debugging
- Game state visualization
- Statistics tracking

## Implementation Notes

### Best Practices
1. Use pure functions when possible
2. Implement immutable data structures where appropriate
3. Include proper error handling
4. Add comprehensive documentation

### Kotlin-Specific Guidelines
1. Utilize data classes for value objects
2. Use nullable types appropriately
3. Implement sealed classes for state management
4. Follow Kotlin coding conventions

### Example Usage
```kotlin
// Game initialization
val game = MinesweeperGame(Difficulty.BEGINNER)

// Game actions
game.revealCell(0, 0)  // Returns success/failure
game.toggleFlag(1, 1)   // Returns success/failure

// State checking
val state = game.getGameState()  // Returns current game state
```
